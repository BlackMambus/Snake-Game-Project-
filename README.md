🐍 Snake Game – A Classic Arcade Legend

The Snake game is a timeless video game where players control a growing snake that slithers around the screen to collect food while avoiding collisions with the walls or its own tail. Originally inspired by the 1976 arcade game "Blockade," it found iconic status on early Nokia phones and has since evolved into countless versions and remakes.

🎮 How It Works:
Objective: Guide the snake to eat items (usually dots or apples) which cause it to grow longer.

Challenge: As the snake grows, the space to move shrinks—players must skillfully avoid running into the snake’s body or the boundaries.

Controls: Simple directional inputs—up, down, left, right—are all you need, but mastering movement takes practice!
